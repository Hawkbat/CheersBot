Architecture
    Change to an event-stream model piped over server-side events
    Hydrate users on-demand to reduce memory overhead (bots and channels need to always be running to listen for events)

Channel Features
    Non-channel-point notifications
        Follow
        Sub
        Gifted Sub
        Bit
        Donation
        Raid
        Host
    
    Stream goals
        Follows/Subs/Bits/Donations
        Optional start/end dates
        Fun animations or sounds when goals are reached

    Configure Bots
        Allow multiple bots to be registered to the channel (for debugging purposes mostly)
        Configure which bot is primary via dropdown
        Configure which bots have access via UI

    Configure Users
        Allow multiple users to be given access to the channel control panel (e.g. moderators, trusted users, alt accounts)
        Configure which users have access via UI

    Notification settings
        Trigger-via-timeout (mostly done)
            Still need configurable timer
        Grouping/merging options (add, replace, maximum, total)
        Auto-expire timer
        Custom notification messages
        Custom emote icon (chosen from streamer icons via twitchemotes API)

    Channel Point rewards
        Configure rewards in UI
        Enable/disable notifications
        Out-of-stock bot messages and/or notifications

Other Features (Long-Term)
    Viewer game drafting/raffle system
        Opt in via chat command, optionally giving context (competitive rank, etc.)
        Rules for randomly selecting participants
            Randomly from first X viewers in queue
            Chance multipliers for followers/subs
        Choose to move to back of queue or remove from queue
        Make sure viewers aren't counted multiple times
    Chat vote system (not really necessary, but could be fun to do for a "complete package" overlay)
    VOD review queue (Overwatch)
        Maybe work for generic queues of items (although Overwatch-specific functionality can be a submode)
    Twitch-integrated VRM-compatible games


Girl DM Ideas
    Evil counter - Done!
        When a say redeem happens, look for the keywords "evil" or "war crimes"
        If you find it, add to the "evil_dm_" counter

Bugs
    Hitting "Complete" and then "Thoroughly patted" in short succession causes the counter to go negative
    Users need access to the default channel ('hawkbar') to be able to use their own control panels - Might be fixed, needs testing
    Evil counter not triggering on say redeems, needs investigation

Add timer combination modes (replace, extend)


Win/Loss/Tie counter
    Use either control panel or owner/moderator chat commands
    Make visibility toggleable from control panel since it shouldn't always be active

Log client-side errors by building a buffer of log messages and sending them on an interval, silently requeuing them if the server was not accessible
Filter out server unavailable errors from CloudFlare since those are frequent

Temporarily disable action buttons when firing off an async process, showing a spinner while the async function runs and then reenabling when the function returns. If an error occurs, show an error icon in the button which shows the error message on mouse over.
